## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for interacting with the HobbyMatch:

- `GET /hobby/:uid`: Retrieves all hobbies by user ID from a signed in user.
- `POST /saveHobby`: Saves a hobby to Google Firestore's database under a user's ID.
- `DELETE /hobby/:uid/:title`: Deletes a hobby from Google Firestore's database by title.

## Getting Started

To run HobbyMatch locally, follow these steps: 

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/HobbyMatch.git`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. If you want to create your own Firebase project, rname the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the configuration settings.
5. Start the server in development mode: `npm run server-dev`.

## Code Example

This portion of the code resides in the controllers.js file, which performs basic CRUD operations with Google Firestore.
```
    getHobbiesFromDB: async (uid) => {
    try {
      const hobbiesRef = collection(db, 'hobbies');
      const querySnapshot = await getDocs(hobbiesRef);

      const hobbies = [];
      querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
        const hobby = doc.data();
        if (doc.id.includes(uid)) {
          hobbies.push(hobby);
        }
      });

      return hobbies;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error getting hobbies from models:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
```

## Wins and Improvements

Successfully developing a full-stack application while learning Google Firestore DB and Firebase Authentication within a timebox of 3 days was a notable accomplishment. In addition, using vanilla CSS to produce a visually appealing and web accessible application without frameworks helped refine my CSS capabilities. An area for further optimization and improvement would involve recreating the application using React Native.
